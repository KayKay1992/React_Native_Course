<UPDATING AND DELETING BACKEND DATA FROM FIREBASE BACKEND/>

So what will we do here is to introduce more functions in http js file, beside fetch and store we will need function for update expense and delete expense from firebase.
so in update function we will get the id  of the expenses we want to update and expenseData as parameters. then to update we sent a put request to backed url then we target the id of the expense.
