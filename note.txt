<Handling Request Errors/>

things can go wrong while adding spinner to simulate this we can for example add a typo in the url, it can also fail due to internet connectivity issues, due to firebase itself etc. when you reload the spinner the spinner will endlessly be spining. 

we should handle promise rejection and we should show more meaningful feedback to the user about the problem

to achieve this we should add another another overlay component in the ui folder which we called errorOverlay.
